# Shopping-Mall-Customers

## An Unsupervised-Learning, K-Means Clustering Algorithm

The following project is a great example of how unsupervised learning can be used to group similar customer types by using k-means clustering. We can use our results  to determine how to market to each group of customers.  We will use data from a shopping mall that supplies its customers with shopping cards, where customers have to fill out their gender, age, and annual income. Whenever a customer uses his or her card to purchase something at the mall, the card then saves the customerâ€™s shopping history.
