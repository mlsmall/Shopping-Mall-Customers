# Shopping-Mall-Customers

## An Unsupervised-Learning, K-Means Clustering Algorithm

The following project is a great example of how unsupervised learning can be used to group similar customer types by using k-means clustering. We can use our results  to determine how to market to each group of customers.  

We will use data acquired from a shopping mall that supplies its customers with shopping cards. Customers have to fill out their gender, age, and annual income. Whenever a customer uses his or her card to purchase something at the mall, the card then saves the customerâ€™s shopping history.

You can see the results of the K-means clustering algorithm in the figure below.
